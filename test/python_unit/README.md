# Python Unit Tests

These tests, written for the `pytest` framework, are **unit** tests.
That is, they should test the functionality of of each function in the application, without testing interaction effects, or actual connections to a database.

Anything testing interactions or requiring an actual database connection should be covered under integration, system or regression testing.
