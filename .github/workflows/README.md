# GitHub Actions

This directory contains the definitions for [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).
These are automated tasks which can be defined to run when someone pushes to the repository, or upon opening a pull request.
Most of the GitHub Actions we currently use in this repository are for status checks and automated testing, but we may add some CI/CD tasks in the future.

There are comments or descriptions in each workflow's `*.yml` file that provide more information as to the exact steps that are being run at each point.
